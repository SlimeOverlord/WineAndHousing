# WineAndHousing
This is a project that was done as a team of 3 to study supervised learning, more specifically linear and logistic regression. In it, we analyzed a dataset consisting of median house prices in the Boston area, along with the characteristics of the listing, as well as a dataset consisting of different types of wine and their characteristics. We then coded from scratch a linear regression agent in order to predict the average price of a house given some characteristics as well as a logistic regression agent to classify a wine given its characteristics. We then made some experiments on both agents, which can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
